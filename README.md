# First-Five-Multiples-Of-A-Number-Calculator

Hi There!

In this small project, you just have to give a certain number (MUST be in integer form) 
The program calculates the First Five Multiples of a certain number. (Using x,2x,3x,4x,5x)

That's it!

PS: This was done in our school and to store this program safely, I uploaded my code here!
